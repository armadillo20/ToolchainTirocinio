**Master's Thesis**  
**Degree Program**: Computer Engineering, Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence

**Author**: Manuel Boi  
**Supervisor**: Prof. Andrea Pinna

## Overview

This repository contains the source code of the toolchain developed as part of the master's thesis.  
The goal of the project is to provide a modular and extensible toolchain for estimating transaction **fees** and **sizes** for smart contracts deployed (or not yet deployed) on the **Solana** blockchain, specifically those written using the **Anchor** framework.

The toolchain is designed with modularity in mind and integrates several components including:

- **Smart Contract Builder and Deployer**
- **Data Insertion Manager**, both automatic and interactive.
- **Transaction manager**, which computes fees and size, and eventually send transactions.
- **Utility functions** for balance retrieval, contract introspection, and cleanup.

Future extensions aim to support other blockchains and smart contract languages, such as Ethereum (Solidity), Cardano (Aiken), and Algorand (PyTeal).
